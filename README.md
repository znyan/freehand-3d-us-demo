## Installation

**1. Github: Create a new repository**

Click `Create a new repository` to create a new copied repository based on this template for your site

Reference: https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/creating-a-github-pages-site#creating-a-repository-for-your-site

**2. Github: Edit vite config**

in file `vite.config.js`, you should edit the `base` to your repo name xxx

- if your repo name is `yourname.github.io`, set `base:'/',`
- if your repo name is `xxx`, set `base:'/xxx',`

```
base:'/xxx',
```

> This step is just so that you can intuitively understand that the website can work normally in your repository, and you can also make modifications manually in the following steps. 

**3. Github: Publish**

Choose `gh-pages` branch to show your website on github, then you will see your website on `xxx.github.io` or `yourname.github.io/xxx`

**9. After the first deployment**

If you want to update your website again, you can edit your website locally and git push to your repo, `gh-pages` branch and the website will be both updated automatically soon.

## How to edit this template?

- Edit the content `<scripts>` in `.vue`, I have wrote some useful comments.

For example, you can change the original content to your own info (like paper's tile, logo, your name, your address, and the guidance buttons of your other materials) in `src/components/sections/Title.vue`

```
const logo = ''
const title = ''
const title_color = ''
const title_supp = ''
const title_supp_color = ''
const btn_color = ''
const authors = [
  {
    name: "",
    icon: "",
    homepage: "",
    address_flag: ""
  },
  ...
]

const addresses = [
  {
    address_flag: "",
    name: "",
    icon: "",
    homepage: ""
  },
  ...
]

const news = ""

const emphases = [
  "",
  ...
]

const buttons = [
  {
    disabled: ,
    name: "",
    component: ,
  },
   ...
]
```

## How to deploy your own comment area?

> Twikoo is divided into two parts: cloud functions and front-end. To integrate Twikoo on your website, you need to deploy both cloud functions and front-end at the same time. Please pay attention to keeping the two versions consistent when deploying.

There we have deploy the front-end for you, you should only build your own cloud functions.

See [here](https://twikoo.js.org/backend.html) for more details. We recomment that you use [vercel](https://twikoo.js.org/backend.html#vercel-%E9%83%A8%E7%BD%B2) to do this. This can be more arbitrary, depending on you.

After building your own cloud functions, you can edit the config in `src/components/sections/Comment.vue`:

```
// Fill in envId for Tencent Cloud environment; fill in address for Vercel environment (https://xxx.versel.app)
envId: 'https://blog-comment-nvoz-8o7dxhfbd-junyaohus-projects.vercel.app', 
// default: 'ap-shanghai'，Tencent Cloud: 'ap-shanghai' / 'ap-guangzhou'; Vercel: ''
region: '', 
// comment area language， more supported languages: https://github.com/twikoojs/twikoo/blob/main/src/client/utils/i18n/index.js
lang: 'zh-CN',
```
